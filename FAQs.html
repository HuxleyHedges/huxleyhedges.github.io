    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    </br></br>
<button type="button" class"button button2"><h3>Why lay hedges?</h3></button>
</br>
<p>Passers-by often ask ‘what’ and ‘why.’ Hedgelaying is termed a traditional skill. 
  The three main reasons for laying a hedge are: to produce a stock proof barrier, to rejuvenate the hedge from its base and to enhance its wildlife value.</p>
</br>
<button type="button" class="button button2"><h3>Can you lay any species?</h3></button>
</br>
<p>The general rule is that any species that coppices well, will respond well to laying.
  There are exceptions; beech (Fagus sylvatica) does not recover well from being coppiced, and although it will survive being laid, the growth from the base will be minimal. 
  Main hedgerow species include hawthorn, blackthorn, field maple and hazel.</p>
</br>
<h3>When is the best time of year to lay hedges?</h3>
</br>
<p>The hedgelaying season spans from late October to mid-March.  This is the dormant period.  
  As soon as the sap begins to rise and birds show an interest in nesting, the hedging season ends.</p>
</br>
<h3>Does it matter how old a hedge is?</h3>
</br>
<p>A newly planted hedge is best left to establish itself for at least 8 years before laying. 
  Usually, at Huxley Hedges, we specialise in older, more complicated hedges; hedges with large bases, lengthy gaps and unruly ‘bird nest’ appearance. 
  The skill of laying older hedges requires more advanced techniques, including root laying and some coppicing and this level of difficulty is reflected in the higher price per metre.</p>
</br>
<h3>How much will it cost to lay my hedge?</h3>
</br>
<p>This will vary depending on the age of hedge and hence the level of difficulty.  
  However, the cost of materials, stakes and binders, remains the same. Each metre of hedge will require 2.5 stakes and 2.5 bindings at a cost of 120p-160p per piece. 
  As for labour cost, this can be anywhere between £7-£15/m.</p>
</br>
<h3>Will the laid stem carry on living?</h3>
</br>
<p>Yes! The stem (pleacher) is still attached at the base.  
  With the inner bark, the bast and cambium layers still intact then water and nutrients will continue to flow up the stem, keeping it alive. 
  Also, during the first growing season, you will notice regrowth at the base.</p>
</br>
<h3>What is Midland Style?</h3>
</br>
<p>Midland /Bullock style is what we, at Huxley Hedges, choose. 
  It creates a thick hedge designed to be stock proof; cattle would be held on the far side of the hedge which is kept brashy (rather than the neat appearance of the near side).</p>
