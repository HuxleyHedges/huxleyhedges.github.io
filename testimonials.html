     <p>We moved into our South Norfolk home in 1978. The plot is roughly rectangular, about 30y x 100y, with a perimeter of some 260y. 
     Over the years we have let hedges emerge at the border, where previously there was a mix of fencing and very old bits of hedge and brambles. 
     By 2015 the result was a very poor quality hedge boundary, of very mixed age and type, full of bramble and old fencing remains, and totally out of control. 
     Not really fit for hedge laying at all: most professional hedge layers would not have taken it on.  
     But having spotted Alison's advert for Huxley Hedges, we called her up and having looked at it she agreed to have a go at a trial section on the west boundary. 
     It was very tough going, but Alison did a great job. There were some gaps to be filled where the brambles had taken over completely, 
     but overall the result was very satisfactory and a new generation of controllable hedging is emerging. 
     The appearance of the boundary is immediately improved by the use of the traditional stakes and binders to guide the new generation of hedging.
     </br>
Over some 3-4 years Alison has completely restored our 260 yards of boundary hedges, 
     which not only look much better but are also much easier to manage. 
     You need to book Alison well in advance, but she keeps to the dates whatever the weather, 
working sometimes through very heavy rain. A true mixture of fieldworker and artist.</p>
