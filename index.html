<p>
We are Norfolk based hedgelaying specialists, trained in a traditional midlands technique.
<br><br>
No job is too big or too small and we are happy to work in all conditions, on a field or on the roadside.
We are able to provide tailored aftercare advice such as when to cut the hedge back, which plants you should plant when necessary and how to ensure a suitable environment for hedgerow animals.
<br><br>
If you are planning on using your hedges for livestock containment we can ensure that the hedges regrow thick enough to stop any potential escapees.
<br><br>
Due to the nature of the work we are only able to do this job between the end of October and beginning of March, this is to ensure the hedge is at it's most dormant and that our work will not cause any damage.
<br><br>
We are COVID safe as we do not require access to any buildings or equipment.

<p>
Having a hedge laid instead of using fencing or just allowing a hedge to grow has a number or benefits.
<br><br>
It makes for a longer lasting hedge as the cuts allow for new growth throughout the hedge, the new growth also creates a thicker bushier hedge.
This means a richer and more diverse habitat for a number of important insects, birds and mammals.
<br><br>
A well laid hedge can also prevent soil erosion and capture pollutants.
