<p>
We are a Norfolk based hedgelaying specialist, undertaking contract work and offering training courses, in this traditional skill. Individual experience days or group ‘team building’ events can also be arranged.
<br><br>
No job is too small or too big; from private gardens to field boundaries and roadsides. We are able to provide tailored aftercare advice such as which species of hedging plants you can use for infill planting and when to cut your hedge.
<br><br>
The particular style used at Huxley Hedges is Midland/Bullock. This gives a thick hedge suitable for stock proofing.
<br><br>                 
The hedgelaying season is from late October to early March. This is the dormant period for hedges.  When the hedge starts to bud or when birds start to show interest in nesting, hedgelaying must come to an end until the next season.

There are three main reasons for laying a hedge:
                                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                                
<ul>
                                                                                                                <li><p>To create a stock proof barrier</p></li>
                                                                                                                <br>
                                                                                                                <li><p>To rejuvenate the hedge at the base</p></li>
                                                                                                                <br>
   <li><p>To improve its wildlife value, for insects, birds, mammals and amphibians (for hedges alongside ditches)</p></li>
                                                                                                                <br>
</ul>
                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                <p>
<br>
An additional benefit is that a well laid hedge can also prevent soil erosion and capture pollutants.
                                                                                                                </p>
