    <h1>Courses</h1>
<p>We are able to hold courses and outdoor ‘Team Building’ days at £75/head.
Huxley Hedges has been running courses for both individual participants and organisations, including <a href="https://www.tcv.org.uk/" target="_blank">TCV</a>, over the past 20 years.  
Whether you are a beginner or have some experience, the course experience will adapt to your needs. Tools are provided but gloves and sturdy boots are required.
    </br>
Our courses are usually one day and allow people to get a taste for hedgelaying and working outdoors. You are able to learn more about hedgelaying and its importance as well as see
  the skill involved in laying a hedge.
  </br>
A day of outdoor activity has a positive effect on mental health and physical wellbeing and partaking on a course allows you to meet people you share similar outdoor interests with.
